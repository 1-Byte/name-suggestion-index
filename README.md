# name-suggestion-index (aka "NSI")

Canonical features for OpenStreetMap


## What is it?

The goal of this project is to maintain a [canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization)
list of commonly used features for suggesting consistent spelling and tagging in OpenStreetMap.

[Watch the video](https://2019.stateofthemap.us/program/sat/mapping-brands-with-the-name-suggestion-index.html) from our talk at State of the Map US 2019 to learn more about this project!

## How it's used

When mappers create features in OpenStreetMap, they are not always consistent about how they
name and tag things. For example, we may prefer `McDonald's` tagged as `amenity=fast_food`
but we see many examples of other spellings (`Mc Donald's`, `McDonalds`, `McDonaldâ€™s`) and
taggings (`amenity=restaurant`).

Building a canonical feature index allows two very useful things:

- We can suggest the most "correct" way to tag things as users create them while editing.
- We can scan the OSM data for "incorrect" features and produce lists for review and cleanup.
